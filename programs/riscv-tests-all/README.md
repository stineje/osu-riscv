# RISC-V Tests

All the tests in this directory were generated thanks to the following repository: [**riscv-tests**](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) and then adapted to work with **_VSim_**. These tests verify the correct operation of the instructions implemented in the **_VSim_** simulator according to the specification manual: [**riscv-spec**](https://content.riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).
