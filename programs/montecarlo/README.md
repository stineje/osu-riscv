# Monte Carlo Simulation

In Monte Carlo Simulation, the outcome of one scenario is assessed through the outcome of a multitude of random scenarios that involve the same variables. In this case, if you started with *x* amount of money and you bet *y* each time, after *z* total plays, this should accurately predict what the outcome will be. This scenario simulates a simple game of chance, where depending on the value of a random number, the outcome will either be in your favor or the house's favor.

Special thanks to Ross Thompson for helping me in solving my general makefile problems **yet again**, and thanks to [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-house-always-wins-monte-carlo-simulation-eb82787da2a3) for a great python implementation of MCS, along with a very helpful explanation.
